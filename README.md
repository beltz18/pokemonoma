# Pokemonoma

Pokemonoma is a Pokedex-style project built using Next.js and Sass, focusing on first-generation Pokémon. It is fully responsive and allows users to explore details of these Pokémon. To access the Pokedex, users need to log in with an email and password. The project was developed with attention to detail and is hosted on Vercel.

## Run the project

First, install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
  $ yarn
  # or
  $ npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash

  # or
  $ npm run dev
```

Or, if you want to run the project in a custom port:
```bash
  $ yarn dev -p 4000
  # or
  $ npm run dev -- -p 5000
```

Finally, open [http://localhost:PORT](http://localhost:PORT) with your
